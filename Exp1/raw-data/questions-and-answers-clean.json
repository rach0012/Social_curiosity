		"There are a number of factors.\n\nTears from strong emotions are less salty than regular tears which keep your eyeball moist. Since your eyelids are \"more salty\" than the tears, the water from your tears goes into your eyelid tissue to balance out the amount of salt, causing the eyelid to swell.\n\nYou could also say that blood vessels around the eyelid have to expand in order to be able to deliver that much fluid for waterworks. Also, rubbing your eyes can cause it to swell, as the friction can cause irritation of the membranes around your eyes (conjunctiva).",
		"Fear is generally a learned response in humans rather than being present from birth. Whenever a human is observing another human as being a role model, the observer sees the response taken by the role model, and is more likely to recreate that response in the future. Because of this, it's easy to pass on your fear of bugs to another person, as long as that person's subconscious processing thinks you are worth learning from.\n\nOn the other hand, some fears are present from birth as a defensive response to tell an animal to run away when presented with a dangerous situation. Most animals don't fear bugs simply because bugs don't do anything to the animal. But if you put a cucumber behind a cat while it's eating, it will panic and run away because it is born with a fear of snakes, and the cat's innate processing mistakes the cucumber for a threat.\n\nIt's likely that our original fear of bugs did come from the knowledge that certain bugs can have bad or even deadly effects on us, which then spread the mentality that we should be afraid of all bugs. For an animal to fear that same bug, it would have to be because of a survival instinct, unless the animal somehow also learned to fear bugs.",
		"Everyone is effect differently by alcohol due to age, weight, genetics, etc. With chronic alcohol abuse, parts of the nervous system adapt to functioning in the presence of alcohol (aka. tolerance). When the nerves are highly adapted to alcohol, removing it can drastically alter the function of that system, leading so side effects depending on what nerves adapted and how much they adapted.\n\nThe damage that quick alcohol withdrawal varies a lot and can be permanent, for example parts of the brain can die due to a sudden increase in intracellular calcium (not ELI5 but I think its an interesting mechanism.",
		"Basically they use a bunch of methods to estimate what the temps must have been like. They measure ocean sediment composition, ice core samples, pollen samples, tree rings, fossilized leaves etc.\n\nOcean sediments contain different levels of oxygen and different isotopes of oxygen (for example when there is more of a heavier oxygen isotope present it generally means a warmer climate).\n\nDifferent layers of ice cores have different chemical compositions (including oxygen isotopes), which helps piece together what gases were in the atmospshere, and ultimately the temperatures.\n\nThe pollen, tree rings, and leaves contain indicators on how the plants did (how well they survived) at certain times\\/years which would be due to the different climates\\/weather conditions, including temperature.",
		"Ice cream isn't just frozen. It's frozen while being churned. This gives it a fluffier consistency, filed with air pockets. You'd have to refreeze the ice cream while keeping it moving. While at rest, it freezes solid.",
		"Yes, when you drink water it just mixes in with the stomach acid.\n\nYou can think of stomach acid as regular old water that has tiny little lightning bolts floating around in it. These tiny lightning bolts go around blowing apart the food that you eat into tinier and tinier pieces. Your stomach is protected by a layer of snot so that it doesn't get blown up. Eventually the food specks are so tiny that they can be absorbed right into your blood. The food slurry is then sucked into your intestine. The intestine has less snot to protect it, so your liver releases a special lightning-absorbing liquid that makes all the bolts strike out at once, producing a safe, nutritious slurry that's ready for further breakdown and absorption. After all of the nutrients are absorbed, your intestine then absorbs all of the safe lightning-free water and recycles it.",
		"When you drown, you're drastically decreasing the available oxygen in your body\\/lungs as it all gets spent as you suffocate. When you collapse from heart problems, you tend to have available oxygen still in your lungs, as well as in your blood, so the priority of CPR is to circulate the blood until emergency response gets there. Sometimes pausing and taking a breath burdens the effectiveness of the CPR, but it could be necessary in someone who drowns (or else you're circulating spent blood). So if there is oxygenated blood in the body already then breathing can do more harm by pausing CPR compressions\n\n\n",
		"The scientific name for 'bounciness' is the coefficient of restitution.\n\nIt's influenced by two main things; how much an object deforms when it hits something, and how much energy it loses in that process.\n\nSomething very hard like a rock, loses lots of energy when it deforms but is very hard so overall can seem 'bouncy'.\n\nA superball deforms a lot (relatively) when it hits something but doesn't lose much energy, so is also very 'bouncy'.\n\nWhat influences how much energy something loses during impact is a much more complicated question.",
		"Your tongue is covered with 2 types of taste proteins, receptors and ion channels, each of which have multiple subtypes.\n\nThe receptors have a pocket into which only certain molecules can fit, and when the receptor pocket interacts with one of these molecules, it is activated. The activated receptor then sends a signal into the cell that it is attached to, which gets translated into an electrical signal that moves to the brain, where it is interpreted as a taste.\n\nIon channels are similar, in that they send an electrical signal to the brain, but instead, these proteins just allow specific molecules to enter the cell which then activates the electrical signal.\n\nSweet, umami, and bitter use the receptors, salty and sour use the ion channels.\n\nThe important part is that each type of protein is VERY specific, meaning that they will only react to molecules that share similar chemical or physical properties. But as long as the receptor or channel is functioning, they will send the same signal to your brain. So, for example, if you eat white sugar or if you eat an apple, the type of sugar in each is different (glucose vs fructose), but they are both picked up by the same sweet receptor and so both of them will activate a sweet signal in your brain.\n\nSo pyrite tastes like table salt (who is eating pyrite?!) because they both work through the same channel proteins, and send the same flavor signal to the brain\n\nWhat tends to give something its taste is that any given food releases multiple molecules which can be picked up by a combination of different receptors\\/channels",
		"So there's actually a decent amount of things going on here, and an understanding of equilibrium is somewhat required...\n\nFirst, we will assume a near perfect seal on the lid, but it is impossible to assume a perfect seal entirely around the top of the perfume bottle because there has to be a hole for you to spray the liquid perfume out of. This hole is where you'll lose most of the perfume\n\nOne thing you'll need to understand here is vapor pressure. This is the pressure exerted from your liquid perfume onto the gas around it. In a closed container, the pressure around the liquid and the vapor pressure from the liquid will eventually be equal, this is called equilibrium (side note, when a vapor pressure is higher than the surrounding gases pressure, you will see any liquid evaporate).\n\nNow, there is a tiny tube sticking down into the liquid perfume, which separates our perfume bottle from the outside air. This is very important with things like perfume, because they have a very high vapor pressure, which makes them evaporate and is actually why you can smell them distinctly.\n\nThe tube that has been developed is actually a very clever way to keep the perfume inside the bottle. When it is in the liquid it creates surface tension that actually creates an effect that prevents the the liquid from evaporating. Pretty cool right? However, this surface tension only works when the area of the surface of the liquid (surface area) making contact with another gas is very low. But since this isn't a perfect solution, the tube also creates a much smaller surface area for the liquid to evaporate from.\n\nWhen the bottle is on its side, the surface area gets turned on its side, which is too much surface area for the surface tension to make a dent in this evaporation, when the liquid is actually in the tube. This isn't always the case though... sometimes the tube sticks up into the gas, and there's no surface tension at all!\n\nSo with the bottle on its side, the seal created by the tube is no longer effective, and more evaporation happens.\n\nTL;DR: The fast way to explain this is the liquid is no longer in equilibrium with the gas inside the bottle, but rather the air you breathe, which is impossible for a 1L bottle to achieve and thus evaporates completely",
		
		 "Whenever the glass is rapidly cooled during the tempering process there are these air jets that blow cool air on the glass. This creates distortions in the glass that are almost invisible, until you put on polarized glasses. Different automakers have different (patented) patterns or cooling methods to reduce this distortion.",
		 "There are lots of areas of programming that require only basic math. If you\"re doing development for a moderate-sized web site or app, it\"s quite possible you\"ll almost never use any math, and never anything beyond things taught in high-school algebra.\nMore generally, some programmers use a lot of math all the time, some hardly use math at all.\nThere are many more specialized areas of programming that require a lot of math. Computer graphics uses a lot of trigonometry and calculus, so pretty much any game that requires physics or 3-d rendering uses a lot of math. Video and audio compression uses Fourier analysis. Cryptography uses number theory. Those are just a few examples - there are lots of specialties. Good programmers often need to have at least some familiarity with those areas, even if that isn\"t their area of expertise.\nQuite often large-scale software engineering requires more math - for example web sites that need to scale to millions of users. It\"s hard to properly optimize sites to handle a lot of traffic without a good foundation in probability and statistics.\nA degree in Computer Science typically covers many of those things, which is why there\"s a math requirement. In addition, Computer Science involves a lot of mathematical analysis of programs, including determining what\"s possible to compute, determining asymptotic runtime and memory usage, and mathematical proofs of bounds and of correctness.",
		 "Yeah, all food is microwaveable (well, unless it has gold or silver leaf in it as some pastries may).\nNon-microwaveable cookware absorbs microwave radiation and so it\"ll get hot, and also prevent the food from getting hot. That\"s all.\nMicrowaveable cookware generally does not absorb much microwave radiation.",
		 "As shown in this marketing animation for a machine manufacturer, the medication is in a trough between two rollers. The animation shows cute little drops, but the process is to keep enough filling to avoid underweight liquicaps. The dies mold the two sides together and then cuts out the individual pills. These are weighed, to make sure they are full, and only the full ones are sold.",
		 "It just doesn\"t always take a lot of something to have an effect in your body. Cocaine and heroin have different effects on the body, but in general, they target receptors in your brain that then set off cascading reactions all over your body.\nLots of medications have an effect at a much lower dose than the same weight cocaine and heroin. For example, a standard dose of the benzodiazapine clonazapam is 0.25mg. It\"s just formed into larger pills to make it easier to use.\nThe thing is, unadulterated cocaine and heroin aren\"t super deadly in small amounts...provided you are more or less healthy and not using other substances. It\"s when you start mixing substances (like, cocaine and alcohol is bad news for your liver and also increases the risk of heart attack) or using while you have a health condition (it should be fairly obvious why using something like cocaine when you have a heart condition is dangerous). Body weight, how frequently you use, how you use (like snorting versus injecting)...there are lots of different variables.\nWhen you get into the truly hard-hitters like fentanyl, carfentanil, and other analogues, that\"s when things get beyond potent.",
		 "Physiotherapist here!\nELI5: It can be the position our neck is in at night or an injury from earlier in the day.\nLess ELI5: 1) Because many of our normal pain responses and reflexes are inhibited during sleep, we may find ourselves in a position of stress on the joints in the neck to which the stimulus to move does not exceed the necessary threshold for waking up. Sleeping on your stomach or with too many or too few pillows can cause this; try to have a pillow large\/small enough that your head sits in \"neutral\" or in the middle when you lay on your side.\n2) More commonly, stress occurred on the neck the day before. Many people who experience whiplash from a motor vehicle accident will have a delayed pain\/inflammatory response. This likely is due to the mechanics of the synovial joints in our spine. It may be a harmless move in the wrong direction or hours stressed in one position, but many people attribute this morning stiffness erroneously to \"sleeping wrong\". We call this an \"acute torticollis\" - although generally this is a misnomer as many people won\"t actually have an altered head position.\nThe neck is a complicated system of joints, muscles, and stability, so there\"s no one answer on how to avoid \"sleeping wrong\", but one good exercise is strengthening the deep neck flexors longus colli & capitus, which pull the occiput (skull) into a bit of flexion (bent position) and provide tension and stability for the entire neck. http:\/\/www.coreexercisesolutions.com\/chin-tuck\/. Don\"t do this if you get pain during!",
		 "In osmosis, water travels through a membrane from a low-concentration (i.e. less dissolved solids) mixture to a high-concentration mixture until the concentration on both sides is the same.\nThis happens spontaneously and can be quite dramatic if one side is extremely highly concentrated. This is why drinking salt water is so harmful, osmotic pressure starts sucking water out of your cells.\nReverse osmosis is the inverse process, forcing water to cross from the concentrated side to the pure side. This won\"t happen naturally and requires high pressures, but also acts as a very effective filtration process because the membrane excludes most particulates and large ions.",
		 "It\"s from food, and the body doesn\"t wait until sleep to restore energy. This is why a workout or athletic activity feels so much easier a few hours after a meal rather than on a starving stomach.\nWhat sleep restores is not your energy, but your brain function. Your brain is floating in a nutrient soup called cerebrospinal fluid or CSF. Throughout the day, your brain cells drink in nutrients from the CSF, and spit out waste. This builds up, and by the end of the day there\"s so much waste floating around in the CSF that it starts negatively affecting brain function.\nWhen you sleep, channels open up and flush the day\"s supply of CSF away. New, clean CSF is pumped in for tomorrow, and so you wake up with a clean brain.",
		 "Your nose and trachea are lined with tiny hairs, cilia, which are covered in sticky mucus that traps most dust from getting to the lungs. The cilia in your windpipe are always doing a wave, so to speak, that pushes stuff up and out.\n",
		 "It\"s the muscles around the lens, of your eye which is flexible, relaxing and letting it take it\"s natural shape. This is also the reason that it hurts to try and focus on something that\"s too close to your eyes, it squishes your lens too much.",
		 
		 "It\"s a lot like a car.\nA new car you want to repair and replace as much as you can. As the car ages, it gets more expensive and time consuming to repair, and easier to just replace the whole thing.\nNow consider that evolution is about what survives and prospers as a species. And consider the innumerable dangers that could destroy an organism. Nature has a few creatures that do effectively live forever, but as a general rule, replacing constantly works better, so that is what prospered and spread.\nAlso note your own body does the same thing. Rather than make cells that never die, it constantly removed and replaces cells. It\"s such a good system that some of your cells even self destruct or kill other cells to make this happen.\nFurther, note that replacement allows evolution to happen faster. The shorter a creature lives before procreation and the less it sticks around after, the more changes will happen.\nEdit: to summarize, it\"s possible, but evolutionarily speaking, not desirable. Creatures actually moved away from that as time went on.",
		 "Rabies causes extremely painful muscle spasms in the neck and chest when swallowing. So every time they take a drink or even swallow their own saliva it is extremely painful. In later stages of the disease even the thought or sight of water can cause the muscle spasms. So there is an aversion to the stimulus that causes the pain (water) and they become hydrophobic.",
		 "At least part of the answer is that some animals evolved ice-binding proteins or antifreeze proteins. These proteins prevent the growth of ice crystals which can rupture cells.",
		 "Sometimes they don\"t.\nThere are things called line breeding in which breeders intentionally breed related animals (such as ones with the same grandparent).\nPeople will also sometimes breed daughters to their fathers.. one mating of such a combination usually isn\"t a problem but if that offspring was then bred to a close relative that is when problems might show up.\nYou didn\"t really say what kind of animal you were thinking about.. cats.. dogs.. horses.. cattle.. chickens..\nIt\"s quite different for dogs as it would be for horses because people might only own one pair of dogs at a time but with horses they might own 30 mares (females) and 2 stallions (males).. with cattle they might own 300 cows and 0 bulls (they can get frozen semen) so could pick different bulls each year.\nAdditionally most breeders don\"t keep the offspring - they sell them - and might on occasion keep 1 or 2 animals that they produced but then would breed to a different animal.",
		 "https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Nuclear_propulsion#Spacecraft\nI think this is the wikipedia article you\"re looking for.\nThere have been plenty of tests for a variety of nuclear propulsion drives. There are essentially three types.\nNuclear Electric - You have a small reactor or nuclear battery and use the electricity generated from it to power some form of propulsion that relies on electricity, like ion thrusters. Unfortunately, nuclear reactors are quite heavy compared to solar panels, and ion thrusters are so slow they\"re not very practical for manned spaceflight. Nuclear Electric propulsion may have a future someday on a deep space probe that\"s too far out to rely on solar, but as far as I know nothing uses it today.\nNuclear Thermal - Basically, you take a nuclear reactor and pump hydrogen into it. The hydrogen heats up, you let it shoot out the back, propelling your rocket forwards. It\"s kind of like you just spring a leak in the reactor\"s cooling system. Nuclear Thermal Rockets have real promise for providing very efficient thrust, and there have been several projects in the past to experiment or develop them, including a couple that are currently ongoing. But they have problems.\nDue to weight concerns, shielding for the reactor would have to be kept to a minimum. Most designs provide only for a shield dividing the crew from the reactor, meaning everything around the spacecraft would be bombarded with a lot of radiation. The exhaust is also radioactive. That\"s less of a problem if you only use it on an upper stage and rely on a normal chemical rocket to get you to space, but that\"s kind of putting the cart before the horse. They\"re also a pain to test, since you have to collect the exhaust or give cancer to your neighbors.\nYou also have the shared problem with all of these designs- even proven rocket systems fail on a fairly regular basis. If you have enough material for a reactor go up in a high altitude explosion, you\"re going to be raining material down on a very large area. Even if it\"s over the ocean, you\"ll contaminate the food chain. It\"d potentially be worse than Chernobyl.\nAs an aside, I\"d also recommend reading about project pluto. It was a nuclear jet engine on an aircraft, not a nuclear rocket on a spacecraft, but it used a pretty similar principle- it just heated intake air rather than hydrogen fuel. It would have been a nuclear bomber that could fly practically forever, and after dropping its bombs could have spent weeks flying at low altitude to kill more people with sonic booms and radioactive exhaust.\nNuclear Pulse - This is the fun one. Basically, nuclear pulse engines are just shooting a nuclear bomb out the back, immediately setting it off, and riding the force of the explosion. They\"re utterly bonkers. They should be very efficient space propulsion, but they have added political problems. For some reason, launching a huge gun loaded with a magazine of dozens of nuclear bombs into space and having it orbit over everybody\"s heads doesn\"t make other countries happy.",
		 "Alcohol activates a receptor in the brain to tell it to be sleepy and drunk.\nIn long term use, the brain doesn’t want to be sleepy and drunk all the time, so it does three things to maintain a normal awake\/alert state: 1. Gets rid of some of the receptors that alcohol acts on 2. Gets rid of some of the normal brain chemical that says “be sleepy\/sedate” at normal times. 3. Increases the normal brain chemical that says “be awake and alert and active”\nWhen you stop drinking, you now have fewer receptors for chemicals saying “be sleepy” and also less chemicals saying “be sleepy” and also more chemicals saying “be alert and active.”\nThe result? Seizures. Lots and lots of seizures. Which are basically just too much brain activity. Which use up the sugar and energy in the brain and produce poisonous waste products in amounts too high for the body to get rid of it.",
		 "Shortest answer: your tongue always had those bumps, but they are usually very small. If something is to hot\/sweet\/salty than it\"s prepared for, it will swell. This brings in white blood cells faster than usual since your body isn\"t certain if it\"s an infection or not, and it also circulates the blood more so the temperature is regulated and the cells have the resources to repair any damage.",
		 "TL;DR: Depends on whether you have a terrible diet or a good (or even average) diet. They only really help if you have a complete absence of some nutrients; you\"ll get enough to get by if you eat a variety of non-junk foods like most of us do.\nWith a terrible diet, such as if you\"re a senior citizen that can\"t cook and eats very small portions or you live off of low-end ramen noodles or something, you\"re simply missing out on a ton of nutrients, particularly vitamins but also protein and fibre.\nSince you\"re not eating any greens or organ meats at all and stick to inexpensive pre-prepared foods with soft drinks on the side only, you\"re not going to get any Vitamin A, C or K, for example. The first is important for a lot of stuff like vision and immune system, the second helps keep your blood systems healthy, and the last is critical to avoid a condition known as scurvy (but doesn\"t actually do much else despite what the marketers tell you).\n(Omega-3\"s are needed in there too, but it\"s kind of overstated as to how much they help unless you have cardiovascular issues. Bad if you don\"t eat any fish at all ever, usually okay otherwise if you get a trace of \"em from that Tuna Helper casserole or have anchovies on that pizza.)\nAnd there\"s lots of similar vitamins that can be missed if you go the other route and stay completely uniformly vegan too.\nSo if you have a really shitty diet, that once-per-day vitamin pill gives you SOME of those vitamins when otherwise you don\"t get any at all. That\"s good and helpful...\n...but most people don\"t need them if they have a mixed salad once in a while or eat \"fortified\" foods which have them added. In that case, they get arguably limited value out of multivitamins.",
		 "Heat-seeking missiles home in on the heat being generated by the jet\"s engine. Countermeasure flares are launched out of an aircraft and immediately ignite in a very hot flame. Now instead of seeing only one big hot target the missiles sees a dozen targets, and has to choose one.\nThere is a constant battle between missile engineers and countermeasure engineers to design better and better systems. Missiles that can more accurately discriminate between an engine and a flare, and flares that can more accurately simulate the heat of an engine.",
		 "Even if you\"re not swishing it around in your mouth, it\"s still going to touch your teeth at some point. If you don\"t drink soda or any carbonated drinks very often, then this boasts no problem to your dental hygiene. However, if you\"re drinking carbonated beverages every day, then you could see a problem start to develop.\nThe way this works is through a chemical reaction between carbon dioxide and saliva. When these two reactants meet, they form carbonic acid, which brings the pH level in your mouth down. This means your mouth is now more acidic than it is basic. The extra acidity begins erosion of enamel, which is the part of your tooth that protects the dentin from bacteria & what not.\nEdit: So obviously any kind of soda is going to be worse for your teeth than just straight up carbonated water. OP had just asked about \"fizzy drinks\", so I assumed he\/she was concerned about the fizz aspect and not the sugar or anything of that nature.",
		 
		 "The problem here is the white blood cells, or WBCs. They have a nasty tendancy to attack everything they don\"t recognize. When you get a transfusion, the blood is taken from the donor and put into the recipient\"s body - meaning they\"ll start going berserk and attacking everything in sight until subdued. Riot time! It doesn\"t really matter in small quantities, as the recipient\"s WBCs will quickly overpower the donor\"s WBCs. But in the case that you are giving a lot of blood or the recipient has a weak immune system (aka is immunocompromised), the donor\"s WBCs will wreck havoc for a while. Not good.\nTo prevent this, there are a few means for getting rid of the WBCs. You can use a filter \/ centrifuge to physically get rid of them, or you can irradiate the blood to kill the WBCs off. This is possible because only WBCs have nuclei (DNA) that can be damaged by the irradiation. Red blood cells (RBCs) and platelets (plts) do not, and so are unaffected. Since we are generally doing transfusion for the RBCs this works out pretty well.\nAnd of course, no WBCs means no immunity, so nothing gets transferred in the end.",
		 "Its trying to, daily. But there\"s a problem. Jupiter is big. Like very big and therefore has a massive gravitational field. So whenever a group of asteroids start to come together Jupiter comes in and yoinks them apart. Along with the sun keeping them in orbit around it they don\"t really have an option but to stay in a belt until Jupiter stops being so greedy with its gravity well.\nIf u were wondering, the same thing happens with Saturn, sort of. The gravitational pull of Saturn means that the asteroids in its rings can\"t clump together as they are ripped apart by Saturn\"s gravity",
		 "Proximity to your ear. The volume of air displaced by a large subwoofer is large, but it is many feet \/ several hundreds of feet away from your ear. If you are too close to something of this size, you will be doing damage to your ears because the volume of sound waves hitting your eardrum is too large.\nSimilarly, small earbuds produce a bass sound with a very tiny volume, but that earbud is mere millimeters away from your eardrum. Change that even to a few centimeters and the bass sound waves diffuse too quickly for them to affect your eardrum.",
		 "Because 0 decibels is not the same as 0 sound. Decibels are a logarithmic scale. Every time you increase the decibel value by 6, you double the sound pressure level. This means that 0 db cannot represent absolute silence. If you double 0, you still get zero. Negative infinity would be no sound at all, whereas zero is a sound that is incredibly quiet.\nThe zero point was chosen to be something quiet enough that humans cannot differentiate it from silence. But cannot actually represent zero sound, as zero because logarithms can\"t do that.",
		 "They can make money three ways when they are selling you a new car, the dealer markup, and any hidden incentives from the factory.\nThe second way is what they offer you for your trade in.\nThe third way is through financing of the vehicle. They secretly get kickbacks from certain finance companies depending on what rate they offer you. Say, hypothetically, you qualify for a 3% rate, but the finance manager will offer you a loan for 4%, so then the dealership gets a kickback of $500, and if he gets you on the hook for 5%, the dealership gets a kickback of $1000.\nSo the salesperson will usually chat you up and try to pull details about what you want out of the deal, they find out what your \"hot buttons\" are, and lets say you demand to get $5000 for your trade, when it\"s only worth $4000, well then they can jack up your interest rate by two percent and make that back up.\nOr, lets say you demand a certain interest rate, so they agree to that, but the amount of money they will give you on your trade-in just went down.\nSince usually people only have one hot button, it\"s easy for them to find out what that is and then structure that accordingly. So it\"s all a big shell game. You ask for something, they concede, but make it up elsewhere.",
		 "Airline passengers in the US have voted with their wallets and demonstrated that when they are paying for their own ticket, all they care about is price. The only people willing to pay for a premium flight experience are people spending someone else\"s money.\nSecond, US airlines are heavily built around their domestic routes. International operations are an entirely different market with different service standards.\nTo put some numbers to this, as of a couple years ago, American Airlines saw half of its revenue come from the 87% of its customers who flew the airline only once that year. When looking at their fortress hub in Dallas-Fort Worth, they don\"t see their competition as United or Delta, but rather ultra-budget airline Spirit.",
		 "Deciduous trees shed their leaves in order to conserve energy. Leaves take energy to maintain, so it\"s advantageous for the tree if it does not have to deal with leaf upkeep when there is limited warmth and sunlight (in other words, winter).\nThe downside of this is that deciduous trees have to regrow all their leaves the next year, which is something that evergreens do not have to deal with (by the way, I think the question should be deciduous vs evergreen, but that\"s another topic)",
		 "Hormones play a huge role in this. Men tend to store fat around the stomach (android obesity), women in the hips (gynoid obesity). In fact, once a woman hits menopause, and she stops producing as much estrogen, the fat can actually start being stored more around the stomach like the male pattern.",
		 "9mm bullets are dangerous.\nHowever they are a handgun round. They\"re less aerodynamic and have less power coming out of the barrel. They\"re not designed for long-distance flight.\n7.62\/.308 and 5.56\/.223 are rifle rounds. They have more power out the barrel and are designed for long- distance, accurate engagement.",
		 "When you take a close look at a bacteria, it\"s just a little bag of chemicals with a protective skin around it, plus some other stuff like hairs that can help it move. The chemicals are mostly water plus electrolytes and a few complex carbon-based molecules.\nIf the bacteria is placed in boiling water, the pressure inside rises and ruptures that skin, and then the chemicals inside leach out and dissipate into the water, while some get changed into other chemicals in the same way stuff like an egg changes when it cooks. But it\"s such a tiny amount of material and it\"s dispersed so thoroughly through so much more water that it\"s not noticeable or harmful or anything.\nBaking or frying it does the same thing, rupturing the skin, except in this case there\"s no water to carry the chemicals away, so after the fluid in the bacteria evaporates you have a itsy-bitsy stain. RIP bacteria.",
		 
		  "Skunking occurs when beer is exposed to certain wavelengths of light. This is why beer is typically bottled in brown bottles. Clear and green bottles protect the beer less, which is why popular brands in those color bottles often have the distinctive flavor.\nThe chemical responsible for the distinctive flavor is called MBT, and is produced when the energy in light causes the riboflavin (produced by yeast during fermentation) in beer to chemically react with the alpha acids from the hops.",
		  "Many of these have multiple meanings, these are the ones I run across most often.\nBeat: a length of time. This is used nonmusically as well, “step on stage, give a beat, then deliver your line”. In music is it usually the pulse that you can clap to. In 4\/4 time, for example you get 4 beats in your bar.\nBar: a bar is a logical collection of beats. Bars usually get 3 or 4 beats, but other options are possible.\nStep: I usually see this in composition programs. It is common to have a run of notes that are all the same length, for example 8 sixteenth notes. The step is the distance between each note. If you were notating this, you want to step at sixteenth notes. You typically set your step to eighth notes or triplets or quarter notes.\nTempo: how fast the beats happen. Usually measured in “beats per minute” or BPM.\nRhythm: this is the collection of notes in the music. Take all the notes in a phrase, and that is the rhythm.\nTact: I have never heard of this.",
		  "My sister told me a long time ago that dirt is the enemy of suds and that stuck with me. But it\"s basically true. Your hair has oils that are important to its structure. Those oils allow dirt to cling to it. Shampooing strips away those oils and thus the dirt. but remember dirt is the enemy of suds so you won\"t lather up the first time you do it. That\"s partially why shampoo instructions say to do it twice, to waste more product and to make sure your hair is actually clean. The second one will probably lather up considerably. Alternatively if you wash your hair too much it will always lather but you are doing considerable damage to your hair.\n",
		  "There aren’t really good answers to this question. Therapists have a bunch of different approaches that all would answer the questions in different ways and yet all seem to work just as well. The part of therapy that has been shown to hold a positive correlation with the outcome of therapy is a concept called “therapeutic alliance” which is basically just a metric of the quality of the working relationship between client and counselor. The better their alliance, the better the outcome. This is true regardless of the therapists theoretical orientation which itself has a huge impact on the content of the treatment. Beyond that bit, therapy is consistently shown to be effective, so that’s not in doubt, but it’s hard to show good data about why it works.\nFrom my orientation, I see therapy as effective because it allows people to organize their thoughts and feeling so that they are comprehensible rather than nebulous and scary. But I also work really hard to maintain a good relationship where people feel safe to say whatever they want and feel anything they want. And honestly, I feel like if I can do that then the people will just heal by themselves, just by virtue of having someone they feel safe with.",
		  "Usually this is due to ischemia- lack of blood. When you\"re sitting in a position too long your body tells you to move, whether or not you realize it, to get the blood flowing back. If blood is robbed from an area of your body for too long, the tissue dies.\nIf you don\"t move, you get something called a pressure ulcer. Pressure ulcers have four stages and a last stage called unstageable. They are not pretty sights (do a google search). People get these because they cannot move when their body tells them to. Thus, the blood flow stops and the tissue in the area dies. In the hospital, we have turn schedules for our paralyzed patients to turn them every hour or two so their flesh doesn\"t die.\nWhen you\"re sleeping, your body is unconsciously moving to keep that blood flowing all while you rest peacefully.",
		   "Played at the same speed, the difference is in the accent — that is, where you put more emphasis.\nListen to Sousa\"s Fairest of the Fair. As soon as the drums kick in, you should be able to get a really strong \"one, two. one, two.\" sort of feel. That\"s what 2\/2 or 2\/4 sounds like.\nNow pay attention to the bass line for Queen\"s Crazy Little Thing Called Love. That\"s a \"one two three four\" feel. That\"s your 4\/4.\nLet\"s try the ones that are multiples of three now. 3\/4 vs 6\/8 is the difference between \"One and Two and Three and One and Two and Three and (...)\" for 3\/4, and \"One and a Two and a One and a Two and a (...)\" for 6\/8: one has three beats that divide into two halves, the other has two beats that divide into thirds. You can hear this difference in Bernstein\"s America from West Side Story: The bit that goes \"I like to live in A-me-ri-ca\". Note how The first half has two accents (\"I\" and \"live\") and is in 6\/8, and the second half is 3\/4 with emphasis on \"me\", \"ri\", \"ca\".",
		  "Originally beverages were carbonate via fermentation, which produces CO2 as the yeast or bacteria eat some of the sugars. Some beverages still are done this way, such as beer. CO2 is still used because it\"s cheap and adds the acidic flavour. Some of the CO2 in the drink forms carbonic acid.\nAir couldn\"t be used because it contains oxygen, which will allow for the beverage to spoil. Other gases can be used though. Guinness beer for example uses a mix of CO2 and nitrogen, giving it a more foamy head.\nIn general, for a gas to be used for \"carbonation\", it would need to:\n- not cause the food to spoil (which is pretty much just oxygen)\n- not cause some sort of undesirable chemical reaction with the beverage. CO2 will make some carbonic acid which is fine, but others may make more of worse chemicals.\n- not have any negative odour or taste. You wouldn\"t want sulfur based gases that smell like rotten eggs.\n- they would obviously need to readily dissolve in water. Helium for example would probably work fine, if you could actually get it to dissolve as well as CO2.\n- I suppose I should add on not be flammable would be nice too, as even if methane (aka natural gas) or hydrogen could work, they would also be a little dangerous.\n- Also in the extreme, you wouldn\"t want it being poisonous. We add a little chlorine to water to kill bacteria, but you wouldn\"t want a rupture of chlorine coming out of a beverage or it will kill you. Lots of other toxic gases you wouldn\"t want in there.\n- Again in the extreme end, you wouldn\"t want the gas to be a environmental issue. Something like SF6 may very well work, but you wouldn\"t exactly want a lot of that getting into the atmosphere.\nA lot of gases wouldn\"t work for one of these reasons or another. I\"m sure there\"s some other gas out there other than CO2 and to a lesser extent N2, they however most likely wouldn\"t be as cheap and easy.",
		  "The foaming is usually caused when there is a lot of saliva in the mouth. For example, when someone has a seizure they can\"t swallow properly. The saliva builds up and grunting\/gargling the saliva this causes it to become foam like.\nIt\"s similar in neuro diseases like rabies. Rabies can cause hypersalivation so you salivate more. Rabies also makes it very painful to swallow (this is why people with rabies develop fear of water) since they aren\"t drinking a lot of water and salivating excessively while also not swallowing the saliva it appears as a frothy foam coming from the mouth.",
		  "Hey there\nI work for 2 major broadcasting companies in Canada, and in one (where I currently am, on a 10 hour shift) I am the person who ingests, quality checks, and approves all the commercials we air across all of our 7 channels.\nSo in Canada and the US, there are laws dictating how loud content is allowed to be. This includes both the actual show you are watching\/listening too, and the commercials that are in between. Basically, the government says \"the maximum output allowed by anyone is _______\" and we all have to abide by that. My companies policy is that commercials must be withing -24 +\/-2 LKFS (LKFS is a measurement of loudness). So every night I get a sheet of 40-150 commercials that need to be ingested, and I adjust their levels to be within this range.\nSo the best way to think about this is that the commercials themselves are not what are loud. Everything else is quiet. A standard has been set for everything across the entire network, and commercials are always safely within the margins. However, since the content you are actually trying to watch is dynamic, with loud and quiet spots, you likely are listening to it slightly louder than that standard would want you to so its easier for you to hear dialogue, or quiet parts in the show\/music. This is especially noticeable if you constantly ride the volume level on your stereo or television when something loud happens. Since commercials generally want to be heard easily, and typically don\"t have dynamics, they seem to be much louder than everything else.\nSide Note: There are ways that commercials can actually be slightly louder than others. Since the volume standard we use is an average over the entire spot, a quiet commercial with a loud portion at the end or a commercial of just straight dialogue vs dialogue over music can come out with different averages. Generally I adjust the volume of spots like this that seem super loud so they are more in line with the standard.\nHope this helps",
		  "The short answer is probably pretty unsatisfying: because that\"s the way it is. There is no reason that light, energy and everything else has to move in waves. In fact, some really smart people (such as Isaac Newton) initially thought that light was just particles that moved in a straight line.\nHowever, eventually we observed phenomena like diffraction, which posed a serious problem for the idea that light is just a bunch of particles flying through the air. However, diffraction and other such phenomena are easily explained if light is a wave.\nSo light must be a wave? Not so. Albert Einstein came along and solve the problem of the photoelectric effect, which he did by assuming that, instead of waves, light actually was just particles flying around.\nSo who\"s right? Those who observed diffraction and said light must therefore be waves? Or those who observed the photoelectric effect, and said that light must therefore be particles? The answer is, both and neither. And an experiment was done that showed just that. Turns out, light is not a wave, although it acts like a wave sometimes. And light is not a particle, although it also acts like a particle. It\"s something totally different.\nAll mass and energy in the universe is now understood to have wavelike and particle-like behavior. So no, there is no way to transfer energy that avoids the wave-like nature of mass-energy."
